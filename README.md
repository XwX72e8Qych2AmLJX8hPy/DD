<h2> Digital Forensics Projects:</h2>
<b> I completed the Introduction to Digital Forensics certification by Security Blue Team. Used digital forensic techniques to locate hidden data on a workstation. Used steghide to extract embedded PII within image and music files. Discovered files with hidden extensions and used fcrackzip to brute force a zip folder and also used a dictionary attack supplied with the rockyou.txt wordlist in Kali Linux</b>

<h2> Threat hunting Projects</h2>
<b>I completed the Introduction to Threat Hunting certification by Security Blue Team. Performed indicators of compromise (IOC) analysis using Mandiant IOC Collector. After creating a set of IOC files from sample downloads I documented the file name, file size, file path, and file hashes for md5, sha1sum. I later used Mandiant Redline to create a custom IOC script and search those IOCs within real malware on a Windows 10 machine hosted in VMware</b>

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been playing the piano since a very young age. I taught myself to play and read sheet music. The only lessons I signed up for happened during my Master's program in college. I took piano practice for two semesters where I was about to improve my playing. Prior to taking these brief lessons, I was already able to play the piano very well. I prefer to play classical, video game, and anime music on the piano.
